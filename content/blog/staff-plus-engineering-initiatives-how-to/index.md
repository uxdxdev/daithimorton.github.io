> So you’ve identified the engineering initiatives that are important to your organisation, but how do I actually start working on them? 

For prerequisites see my post on [Staff+ engineering initiatives](/blog/staff-plus-engineering-initiatives/). Once you have these things in place it’s time to get into the weeds on what actually needs to be done in order to successfully complete an initiative. 

Here is a step by step guide to executing on an engineering initiative:

1\. Assess Priority Based on Vision:
- Start by evaluating the priority of potential engineering initiatives in alignment with your group's overall vision and goals.
- Understand how each initiative contributes to the long-term success and mission of the organisation.

2\. Select the Top-Priority Problem:
- Identify and select the most critical problem or opportunity that needs immediate attention.
- Consider factors such as potential impact, urgency, and alignment with strategic objectives.

3\. Frame Your Initiative:
- Clearly define the problem you aim to solve. Use a problem statement that succinctly explains the issue.
- Explain why this problem is important, outlining the potential benefits and risks of not addressing it.
- Define what success would look like, setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals.

4\. Secure Sponsorship:
- Seek sponsorship and support for your initiative from the leadership team. This could involve the Director of Engineering, Vice President, CEO, or other relevant executives.
- Make a compelling case for why the initiative aligns with the organisation's strategy and how it contributes to its success.

5\. Identify Key Stakeholders:
- Identify individuals or teams within the organisation who have a vested interest in or can contribute to solving the problem.
- Engage with these stakeholders to gain their support and involvement.

6\. Form a Working Group:
- Create a cross-functional working group consisting of stakeholders and interested parties.
- Ensure that the group represents a diverse set of skills, perspectives, and expertise to tackle the initiative effectively.

7\. Define Roadmap and Milestones:
- Develop a detailed roadmap that outlines the steps, tasks, and milestones needed to achieve the initiative's goals.
- Assign responsibilities and timelines to team members, ensuring clarity on who does what.

8\. Establish Communication and Meetings:
- Set up a communication channel (e.g., Slack, email, or project management tools) to facilitate ongoing collaboration and information sharing.
- Schedule regular sync meetings to track progress, discuss challenges, and make necessary adjustments.

9\. Implement a Time-Boxed Approach:
- Allocate a specific time frame (e.g., 8 weeks) for each initiative's execution.
- Organize a meeting at the end of the allocated period to present results and gather feedback from the working group.

10\. Iterate and Continue:
- After the initial initiative is completed, encourage team members to select and work on new initiatives.
- Repeat the process of problem prioritization, framing, and execution.

11\. Continuous Improvement Process:
- Define a structured process for continuous improvement:
  - Hold quarterly meetings to review agreed-upon metrics that track success for each category of initiative.
  - Evaluate the impact of completed initiatives and identify areas for optimization.
  - Adjust priorities and strategies as needed based on the outcomes and evolving organisational goals.


## Conclusion

By following these steps, your engineering team can effectively plan, execute, and measure the success of its initiatives, ensuring alignment with the organisation's overall vision and goals while fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
