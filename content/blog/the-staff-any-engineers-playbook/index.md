## Staff Engineer Archetypes

*The below archetypes and their descriptions are taken directly from [StaffEng.com](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/), to get a more in-depth explanation of each archetype and a bunch of other very useful stuff go a take a look at their site.*


### Tech Lead

The Tech Lead guides the approach and execution of a particular team. They partner closely with a single manager, but sometimes they partner with two or three managers within a focused area. Some companies also have a Tech Lead Manager role, which is similar to the Tech Lead archetype but exists on the engineering manager ladder and includes people management responsibilities.

### Solver

The Solver digs deep into arbitrarily complex problems and finds an appropriate path forward. Some focus on a given area for long periods. Others bounce from hotspot to hotspot as guided by organizational leadership.

## Summary

Staff engineers are expected to be a force multiplier for the organisation they are working with. You can only do that by getting out of the trees and seeing the forest. The first step to doing this is reducing your coding time and increasing your knowledge of the organisation, it's people, and the projects they are working on. Go talk to people about what they are doing! make friends.

You need to have opinions now, you should be working on what you think will help teams and the business long term. Fight the urge to write code all day, set clear time boundaries for focus and diving deep. You will have people constantly tell you what you should be doing and how you should be spending you time, but you are the captain now. Good luck.
